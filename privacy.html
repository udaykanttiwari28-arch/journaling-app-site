        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My Little Space is a personal journaling and habit tracking app. Your privacy is fundamental to our design. The app stores all data locally on your device and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All your data is stored exclusively on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Journal entries</strong> (text, photos, videos, audio) are saved to your device's local storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Habits and completions</strong> are stored in a local database on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>No data is sent to any server.</strong> There is no cloud backend, analytics service, or third-party data processor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <p>All stored data is encrypted at the application level using AES-256-GCM encryption via Apple's CryptoKit framework. This means your journal entries, habit titles, photos, videos, and audio recordings are encrypted at rest and unreadable without your device's encryption key.</p>

        <h2>iCloud Backup</h2>
        <p>The app offers an optional iCloud Drive backup feature. If you enable it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your encrypted data is copied to your personal iCloud Drive storage.</li>
            <li>Data remains encrypted during backup and in iCloud.</li>
            <li>Only you can access your iCloud Drive backups through your Apple ID.</li>
            <li>This feature is entirely optional and disabled by default.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Face ID / Touch ID</h2>
        <p>The app uses Apple's LocalAuthentication framework to protect access to your journal. Biometric data (Face ID or Touch ID) is processed entirely by the iOS operating system. The app never accesses, stores, or transmits any biometric data.</p>

        <h2>HealthKit</h2>
        <p>The app can optionally read health data (steps, sleep, workouts) from Apple Health to automatically track health-related habits. If you grant permission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Health data is read from Apple HealthKit and used only to display habit completions within the app.</li>
            <li>Health data is never stored permanently, exported, or shared with any third party.</li>
            <li>You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in Settings > Health > My Little Space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Camera, Photos &amp; Microphone</h2>
        <p>The app requests access to your camera, photo library, and microphone to let you attach media to journal entries and use voice dictation. All captured media is stored locally on your device in encrypted form. No media is uploaded or shared.</p>

        <h2>Speech Recognition</h2>
        <p>The app uses Apple's Speech Recognition framework for voice-to-text dictation. When available, on-device recognition is used. Transcribed text stays in the app and is not sent to any external service beyond Apple's standard speech recognition processing.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>My Little Space does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Crash reports (beyond what Apple collects through standard iOS mechanisms with your consent)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or analytics platforms. There are no ads.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete any journal entry or habit at any time from within the app. Uninstalling the app removes all local data permanently. If you have iCloud backups enabled, you can delete backups from your iCloud Drive.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app does not collect information from anyone.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted on this page with a revised date.</p>
